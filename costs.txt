Assumptions:
- EC2 instance: g5.2xlarge ($1.212 per hour)
- EBS volume: 450 GB gp2 ($0.08 per GB-month)
- Weekend period: 60 hours (Friday evening to Monday morning)
- 4 weekends per month
- AMI creation cost: $0.01 per GB

Corrected Calculation:

Option 1: Create AMI, Terminate, and Restore

Savings per weekend:
EC2 instance savings: 60 hours * $1.212 = $72.72

Costs per weekend:
AMI creation cost: 450 GB * $0.01 = $4.50

Net savings per weekend: $72.72 - $4.50 = $68.22

Net savings per month (4 weekends): $68.22 * 4 = $272.88

Option 2: Stop and Start

Savings per weekend:
EC2 instance savings: 60 hours * $1.212 = $72.72

Costs per weekend:
EBS volume cost (still charged when stopped): 
(450 GB * $0.08 * 60/720) = $3.00

Net savings per weekend: $72.72 - $3.00 = $69.72

Net savings per month (4 weekends): $69.72 * 4 = $278.88

Comparison:

1. Create AMI, Terminate, and Restore:
   Net savings per week: $68.22
   Net savings per month: $272.88

2. Stop and Start:
   Net savings per week: $69.72
   Net savings per month: $278.88

Difference in savings:
Per week: $69.72 - $68.22 = $1.50 in favor of Option 2
Per month: $278.88 - $272.88 = $6.00 in favor of Option 2

In this fully corrected calculation, Option 2 (Stop and Start) saves $1.50 more per week or $6.00 more per month compared to Option 1 (Create AMI, Terminate, and Restore). 

The main factors are:
- Option 1 incurs AMI creation costs but saves on EBS volume costs during weekends.
- Option 2 continues to incur EBS volume costs during weekends but avoids AMI creation costs.
