 For your EC2 instance with a g5.2xlarge size and 450GB storage, there are a few options to achieve your goals. Let's explore both scenarios:

Option 1: Backup, Terminate, and Restore

1. Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) or AWS Backup to create automated EBS snapshots of your instance's volumes.
2. Use AWS Lambda functions triggered by CloudWatch Events to:
   - Create a final snapshot on Friday evening
   - Terminate the instance
   - Restore the instance from the snapshot on Monday morning

Case A: AMI saved in the same region
Costs:
1. EBS Snapshots: $0.05 per GB-month
   450 GB * $0.05 = $22.50 per month
2. AMI storage: $0.01 per GB-month for AMI storage
   450 GB * $0.01 = $4.50 per month
3. Lambda: Free tier (assumed)
4. CloudWatch Events: No additional cost

Total additional costs: $27 per month

Savings:
EC2 instance savings: $290.88 per month (as calculated before)
Net monthly savings: $290.88 - $27 = $263.88

Case B: AMI saved in a different region

Costs:
1. EBS Snapshots: $0.05 per GB-month
   450 GB * $0.05 = $22.50 per month
2. AMI storage: $0.01 per GB-month for AMI storage
   450 GB * $0.01 = $4.50 per month
3. Data transfer out to a different region: $0.02 per GB
   450 GB * $0.02 = $9 per transfer (assuming one transfer per week)
   $9 * 4 weeks = $36 per month
4. Lambda: Free tier (assumed)
5. CloudWatch Events: No additional cost

Total additional costs: $63 per month

Savings:
EC2 instance savings: $290.88 per month (as calculated before)
Net monthly savings: $290.88 - $63 = $227.88

Option 2: Stop and Start

Use AWS Lambda functions triggered by CloudWatch Events to:
- Stop the instance on Friday evening
- Start the instance on Monday morning

Costs:
- EBS volume: You'll still be charged for the EBS volume when the instance is stopped ($0.08 per GB-month for gp2)
- Lambda: Free tier includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month
- CloudWatch Events: No additional cost

Savings:
You'll save on EC2 instance costs for about 2.5 days per week (60 hours), but still pay for EBS.
Weekly savings: 60 * $1.212 = $72.72
Monthly savings (approximated): $290.88
Minus EBS costs: 450 * $0.08 * (2.5/30) = $3 per week or $12 per month
Net monthly savings: $278.88

Comparison:

1. Backup and Terminate:
   Pros: Maximum cost savings, no ongoing EBS charges when terminated
   Cons: Longer start-up time on Monday, potential data loss if snapshot fails

2. Stop and Start:
   Pros: Faster start-up time, lower risk of data loss
   Cons: Slightly lower savings due to ongoing EBS charges

Both options provide significant savings. The backup and terminate option offers maximum savings but with a slightly higher complexity and longer start-up time. The stop and start option is simpler and faster to resume but has slightly lower savings.

To implement either option, you can use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to create the necessary resources (Lambda functions, CloudWatch Events, IAM roles) in an automated and reproducible way
